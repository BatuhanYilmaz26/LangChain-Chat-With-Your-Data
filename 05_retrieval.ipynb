    "# Retrieval\n",
    "\n",
    "Retrieval is the centerpiece of our retrieval augmented generation (RAG) flow. \n",
    "\n",
    "![](images/retrieval.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "We talked in the previous lesson about **semantic similarity search**, but we're going to talk about a few  different and more advanced methods here. \\\n",
    "The first one we're going to cover is **Maximum Marginal Relevance**, or MMR. \n",
    "- The idea behind this is that if you just always take the documents that are most similar to \n",
    "the query in the embedding space, you may actually miss out on diverse information, as we saw in one of the edge cases.\n",
    "\n",
    "|            |                          |\n",
    "| ----------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------- |\n",
    "| ![](images/mmr.png) | ![](images/mmr2.png) |\n",
    "\n",
    "- In this example, we've got a chef asking about all white mushrooms. \n",
    "  - And so if we take a look at the most similar results, those would be the first two documents, where they have a lot of information similar to the query about a fruiting body and being all white. \n",
    "  - But we really want to make sure that we also get other information, like the fact that it's really poisonous. \n",
    "  - And so this is where using MMR comes into play, as it will select for a diverse set of documents.\n",
    "- The idea behind MMR is that we send a query in, and then we initially get back a set of responses, with  \"fetch_k\" being a parameter that we can control in order to determine how many responses we get. \n",
    "- This is based solely on semantic similarity. \n",
    "- From there, we then work with that smaller set of documents and optimize for not only the most relevant ones, based on semantic similarity, but also ones that are diverse. \n",
    "- And from that set of documents, we choose a final \"k\" to return to the user. \n",
    "\n",
    "Another type of retrieval we can do is what we call **self-query**. \n",
    "- This is useful when you get questions that aren't solely about the content that you want to look up semantically, but also include some mention of some metadata that you want to do a filter on. \n",
    "\n",
    "![](images/retrieval2.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "- So let's take the question, what are some movies about aliens made in 1980? \n",
    "- This really has two components to it. \n",
    "- It's got a semantic part, the aliens bit. \n",
    "- So we want to look up aliens in our database of movies. But it's also got a piece that really refers to the metadata about each movie, which is the fact that the year should be 1980. \n",
    "- What we can do is we can use a language model itself to split that original question into two separate things, a filter and a search term. \n",
    "- Most vector stores support a metadata filter. So you can easily filter records based on metadata, like the year being 1980. \n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, we'll talk about **compression**. \\\n",
    "This can be useful to really pull out only the most relevant bits of the retrieved passages. \\\n",
    "- For example, when asking a question, you get back the whole document that was stored, even if only the first one or two sentences are the relevant parts. \n",
    "- With compression, you can then run all those documents through a language model and extract the most relevant segments and then pass only the most relevant segments into a final language model call. \n",
    "- This comes at the cost of making more calls to the language model, but it's also really good for focusing the final answer on only the most important things. And so it's a bit of a tradeoff.\n",
    "\n",
    "![](images/compression.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's see these different techniques in action."
