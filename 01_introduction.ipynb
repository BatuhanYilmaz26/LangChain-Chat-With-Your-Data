    "- We will first cover how to use **LangChain Document Loaders** to load data from a variety of exciting sources.\n",
    "- We will then touch on how to **split these documents into semantically meaningful chunks**. This pre-processing step may seem simple but has a lot of nuance.\n",
    "- Next, we'll give an overview of **semantic search**, a basic method for fetching relevant information given a user question. This is the easiest method to get started with but there are several cases where it fails.\n",
    "- We'll go over these cases and then we'll go over how to fix them.\n",
    "- We'll then show how to use those retrieved documents to enable an LLM to answer questions about a document but show that you're still missing one key piece in order to fully recreate that chatbot experience.\n",
    "- Finally, we'll cover that missing piece, **memory**, and show how to build a fully functioning chatbot through which you can chat with your data.\n",
